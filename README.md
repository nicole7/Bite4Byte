This project is a w.i.p for a recipe app that people can share and connect with others who have eyes and stomachs equal in size. Customers can add their own recipes to their profile or search and save recipes via an API. Those who have not signed up can do a general browse of the site but will be prompted to create an account if they wish to have access to further foody goodness. 

MVP is:
- user posts
- search API

Added features will include the 'friending' and sharing. Currently, I have devise set up but am working with BCrypt. I plan to also reimplement OAuth into this as well as adding notifications (email and text).
