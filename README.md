This project is a w.i.p for a recipe app that people can share and connect with others whos eyes and stomachs are equal in size. Users can add their own recipes to their profile or search and save recipes via the recipe API. Those who have not signed up can do a general browse of the site but will be prompted to create an account if they wish to have access to further foody goodness. 

MVP is:
- user posts
- search API
- friendng other users

Added features will include liking, sharing and commenting other user's posts. Currently, I have devise set up but am working with BCrypt. I also plan to reimplement OAuth as well as notifications via email and text.
